It\'s a very exciting time. Obviously my goal is Cortina but if this is the way we start, I think I\'m in a good spot."\n\nVonn seized skiing\'s oldest World Cup winner record from Switzerland\'s Didier Cuche, who had held since his victory in the super-G at Crans Montana, USA in 2012 aged 37.\n\nThe oldest winner on the women\'s circuit was Elisabeth Goergl, of Austria, for her victory in the super-G at Val d\'Isere, France in 2014, at the age of 33.\n\nIt was Vonn\'s 83rd World Cup victory and first since she won in Are, Sweden, in March 2018.\n\nVonn has four overall World Cup titles in the bank from a glittering career that has spanned across 20 years.\n\n"The win means so much to me. I knew in the summer I was on the right path, and all the hard work has paid off," Vonn added.\n\n"I thought I might retire after the last race of the Olympics, because I didn\'t think I\'d be competitive for a title, but I might need to change my approach."\n\nFriday\'s event marked the beginning of the downhill World Cup campaign, with a further eight races set to take place before the World Cup Finals at Kvitfjell in Norway on 21 March.\n\nVonn returns to the St Moritz slope for the next World Cup on Saturday.', 'published_at': '2025-12-12T11:35:13.294Z', 'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/617e/live/78499cc0-d749-11f0-8a07-c3f29e3145bc.jpg', 'source': 'BBC', 'text_hash': '9fe8a536468e771b40443a37fb92130942119493214321a302792762f2dd7ac7'}
